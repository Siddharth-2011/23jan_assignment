What is the difference between a try-catch block and a try-throw-catch block?
answer-
The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.
The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.
The try and catch keywords come in pairs:
try {
  // Block of code to try
  }
catch () {
  // Block of code to handle errors
}

 throw: The throw keyword is used to transfer control from the try block to the catch block.
 The throw keyword throws an exception when a problem is detected, which lets us create a custom error.
 try {
  int age = 15;
  if (age >= 18) {
    cout << "Access granted - you are old enough.";
  } else {
    throw 505;
  }
}
catch (int myNum) {
  cout << "Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.\n";
  cout << "Error number: " << myNum;
}
